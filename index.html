## Visualization 2: Interactive Scatter Plot of Building Size vs. Year Built

<iframe src="scatter_plot.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This scatter plot explores how the size of state-owned buildings (in square footage) relates to their construction year. Each point represents a building, colored by county. The visualization helps reveal trends in building size over time and enables regional comparisons by filtering on county.

**Design choices and encodings:**

- The x-axis encodes **Year Constructed** (quantitative, no zero baseline).
- The y-axis encodes **Square Footage** (quantitative, no zero baseline).
- Points are colored by **County** (legend omitted to reduce clutter; county is shown in tooltips).
- Tooltips are formatted for clarity, showing building name, city, year, and size.
- A dropdown selector allows users to filter by county or view all counties at once.
- Pan and zoom interactivity (`.interactive()`) is enabled for detailed exploration.

**Data transformations:**

- Records with missing `Year Constructed` or `Square Footage` are dropped.
- Both fields are explicitly converted to numeric types for compatibility.
- An “All” option is added to the dropdown for comprehensive viewing.
- The plot is saved as `scatter_plot.html` for embedding.

**Interactivity:**

- The dot plot supports multi-selection for comparing counties.
- The scatter plot features a dropdown for county filtering and pan/zoom for detailed inspection.
